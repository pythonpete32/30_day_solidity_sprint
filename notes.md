# Notes

## Ideas

- [] refactor all the contracts into truffle projects
- [] once I get to the advanced solidity lessons, start the testing course and start creating tests for past projects

Today i feel like I have got over that absolute novice stage. I am comfortable reading solidity and with the synytax, also feel comfortable using truffle to create migrations and migrating to a local chain. Today I start working on the DAO contract, this is quite exciting for me as the primary reason for me undertaking this is my interest in DAOs and Aragon.

So far ive been following along with the tutorials and sometimes trying to create the contracts before watching all the videos on a topic. Ive had a look at the final .sol file and i recognise some patterns ive worked with before, ie how to keep track of voters, and the multisig pattern. i feel like i probably could write the contract on my own now (ofcourse it would still suck!). it is tempting to take some time out and give it a go, but im going to push forward. The whole idea of this 30 day thing is to get as much done in the time as possible, after July i can take my time and fill in the gaps.

UPDATE: So as it goes, my internet connection has been really shit today, so i ended up finishing the contract myself anyway. I did look at the original code afterwards, but it was pretty much the same. I havent tested it yet though, like the rest of the contracts ill refactor them into truffle projects and do the tests.
