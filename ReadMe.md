# 30 Day Smart Contract Sprint

## What is it

for one month I'm doing a crash course in solidity smart-contract development. The areas i will be focusing on are

### Solidity

of course solidity is the main area ill be focusing on. syntax, data structures and common design patterns

### Truffle

truffle is the most widely used framework for managing build, testing, and deployment.

### Web3 JS

this is the main interface for interacting with web 3 in applications.

## Motivation

I want to contribute more to Aragon and the other communities I'm a part of, to me this means helping build stuff. while my knowledge and understanding of the technology is OK, not knowing the solidity and its tooling is a major barrier for me. more so because the learning curve is quite steep before i can make any meaningful contribution.

## Goals

- build a portfolio of small smart contracts of ever increasing sophistication
- start one larger project integrating all the knowledge I've learnt over the period
- create a fully upgradable dApp governed by a Aragon organisation
- start working on a `good first issue` on the Aragon GitHub

## Resources

- I've signed up to [Eat the Blocks](https://eattheblocks-pro.teachable.com/) and will be doing 2 courses there simultaneously. This will be my primary resource
- i will be working trough various Ebooks primarily [building games with ethereum smart contracts]()
- for the Aragon stuff, ill be using the [dev portal](hack.Aragon.org) as well as rocketchat
- and of course the solidity documentation.
